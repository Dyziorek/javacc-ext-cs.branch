# javacc-ext-cs.branch

This is port of JavaCC version 6.0 with addition of support to generate .NET C# code.
The code generator is highly customizable based on code templates. Unfortunatelly such templates are not sufficent
to generate new language and source modifications are neccessary.

In the samples there is example of parsing CSS style files.
